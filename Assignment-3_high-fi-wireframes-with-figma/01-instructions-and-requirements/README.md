# Assignment 3
Written below are the assignment instructions and submission requirements for lab assignment 3. They were provided by the lab instructor and were copied and pasted directly from the official lab document. 

## Instructions
Head to the website Dribbble, which is a website where designers showcase their UI work. Find a UI design you like which includes at least 10 unique components. I am using the term component to be a complete visual element, e.g. an image, a button, an icon, etc. For example, I would count 16 component in the following design:

<br>

Your assignment is to attempt to recreate this design in Figma.

Rules:

* If a graphical element is a photograph or render, you may either use a screen-capture to isolate the image, or find a similar image on    the internet. A max of 3 elements can be just pictures - if your design has more pictures, that’s fine, but you’ll need at 7 least        seven additional components.
    * If the images are masked, you should try to mask them too!
* If an element is not an image, and is just geometry, like an icon, you must attempt to make it using the vector manipulations             operations we saw in figma. (Rounded rectangles, clipped chunks, pen tool, boolean operations, etc.)
* Repeated elements only count as one module, even if there are minor variations, e.g. different photos or different text do not count as   different components
    * Component may be nested, e.g. a card with an icon, a title and a tag
    * This would count as 4 elements - one for the overall layout, and one for each component
* Do not choose a project that is too ambitious!
    * You may choose a mobile or desktop design.
    * You can do just one or two pages of a multi-page design as long as it has at least 10 components.
* Please cite the designer of your website or app, especially if you plan to use this on your portfolio for this class. (Give credit        where credit is due!)
    * You should not be using this on your portfolio in general as you didn’t actually design the layout, colors, etc., this is just an         excercise to hone your skills.
       * Using what you learned to make your own design would make an excellent portfolio piece, but is well outside the scope of this             lab activity!

## Requirements
Please submit your Figma file (.fig) file to URCourses by the due date. Also include the URL to the design you attempted from dribbble in a separate text file.
