# Assignment 1
Written below are the assignment instructions and submission requirements for lab assignment 1. They were provided by the lab instructor and were copied and pasted directly from the official lab document. 

## Instructions
Grocery Delivery App:

Using StoriesOnBoard, create a new, private, solo board which represents the User Story Map for an application for getting groceries delivered. Perform User Story Mapping to develop a map which captures the most necessary user stories for this application. You do not need to exhaustively document ever possible feature in the application, just a reasonable and functional subset, meeting the requirements listed:

 * At least three (3) epics in the backbone
 * At least six (6) steps in the walking skeleton
 * At least eighteen (18) total tasks
    * All tasks need to have a name, status and time estimate, but the estimates need not be realistic
 * At least 3 detailed tasks
    * Edit the details of at least three (3) of the tasks, using the Mike Cohn template (As a , I want to , so that .)
 * At least 2 releases, including some unscheduled tasks
 * At least 1 extra feature not discussed in lab, such as additional card colors, annotations or personas
 * A readme.txt file which explains the following:
    * Your general thought process for developing your user story map
    * At least three decisions you made when creating the stories in map
       * Why you made those decision
       * How the results of those decision are captured in the user story map
    * What is the extra feature that you tried?
      
Remember: the map does not need to exhaustively capture every feature of the application.

Running Assignment - Development Portfolio
* Start a new (private for now) GitHub Repo which will be your portfolio for the course
* Upon completing assignments, take screenshots and push them to the repo
* You will add to this repo all semester!
* For this lab, you only need to have a readme.md uploaded, which contains markdown code that explains the purpose of the repoistory.


## Submission Requirements 
1. One or more screen captures of the overview of the User Story Map
   * Ensure that your username is visible in the map
2. Three screen captures of your three detailed tasks, one capture each
3. Include a readme.txt explaining your rationale when creating the User Story Map, as detailed in the Assignment    section, and which extra feature you tried
4. Include a screen capture of your GitHub repo so far, which should still be private

(This should be a total of 6+ files)
