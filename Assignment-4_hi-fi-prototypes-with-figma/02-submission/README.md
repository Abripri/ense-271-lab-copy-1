# Submission Overview


## Design and Interactions

### Design

The main inspiration for my work's design was Minecraft, the game the featured city was built in. The green and light blue colour palette was inspired by the game's day time sky and recognizable grass blocks, the blocky font is similar to the font of the Minecraft logo, and the black bar at the bottom of all the pages was inspired by the game's bedrock blocks that mark the bottom of a world.

### Interactions

Theses interactions can only be done in the Figma prototype.

* **All pages:** On the main menu at the top of each page, the "Home", "Mall", "Mountains", and "NCF" buttons are all interactable. They take you to their respective page.

* **Home Page:** The "More Info" buttons in the "Popular Locations" section take you to the linked location page.

* **Mall Page:** To navigate through the featured images, you must click on the little dots below the images.

* **Mountain Page:** To navigate through the featured images, you must click on the arrows located on either side of the images.

* **Nuclear Containment Facility (NCF) Page:** To increase the size of an image, you must click on the image to want to view. To minimize all the images, click on the current highlighted image.

### Best Way to View the Design

The best way to view the design is with the [interactive Figma protype](https://www.figma.com/proto/kr9Rdczi7fJGTcgPcBwGXM/ense271-lab4-2025-copy?node-id=10-21&p=f&t=Z3vlPOSDYbO7SyCb-1&scaling=scale-down-width&content-scaling=fixed&page-id=0%3A1&starting-point-node-id=10%3A21) (this link will take you to Figma). It is displayed like an actual website and you can fully interact with everything that is meant to be interacted with.

**You do not need a Figma account to view and interact with the protoype.**

**If the side of the page is cut off:**
   * Locate and press the settings button in the top right corner. Make sure the "Fit width" option has a check mark.

**If the Figma menu bar is in the way:**
   * Option 1: Press Ctrl\         
   * Option 2: Locate and press the settings button in the top right corner. Click on "Hide UI".        
  * To unhide the Figma menu: Press Ctrl\

### PDF version

Here is a [PDF version](overview-images/lab4-PDF.pdf) of the design. It is not interactive and the quality of the images is worse than the Figma prototype.

### Semi-Interactive GitHub Tour

[Click here view the tour.](overview-images/home-page)

It lets you swap between different pages and displays all of the featured images. Though, the pages and images themselves are not interactive. **Clicking on the images will take you to a different folder, so I recommend not clicking them.**
