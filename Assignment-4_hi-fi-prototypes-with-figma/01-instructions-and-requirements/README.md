# Assignment 4
Written below are the assignment instructions and submission requirements for lab assignment 4. They were provided by the lab instructor and were copied and pasted directly from the official lab document. 

## Instructions
Your project for this lab is to create a virtual tour, a prototype of a simple webpage which simulates touring somewhere you know very well. This could be a place you are originally from, a place that you visit in your daily life, or a fictional location that you know well, such as from a science-fiction or fantasy world from a book, media or game. I also love seeing any worlds you have created - show off your worldbuilding skills! You virtual tour should include:

* A home page
* A menu (properly connected so that every page is accessible)
* Three landmark pages, which showcases a specific feature of your locale, with a page for each
    * Each landmark should have, at a minimum, a name, a set of images and text description
    * The images should be stored in some type of interactive image container
      * You can use up to two from the pre-lab, but I’d like to see you try to create at least one of your own
      * Use a different type of interaction for each page
        * At least one of the three must include a Smart Animate of a transform, such as size
        * Leave a note in the figma file to explicitly show where you are using the Smart Animate, and how to navigate any interactions             which may not be obvious.
          
Please include some images from the landmarks. If using a common real world location, you can find many images on the web in the creative commons, but for education purposes, it is okay to included copyrighted images as this project as it is for educational / non-commercial purposes. Just be aware of the implications if you intend to use this in your portfolio. If doing a virtual world, concept art, game screen captures, sketches, whatever to showcase the visual identity of the world.

As we are now at the half way point of the lab, do not forget about your running assignment of maintaining a github portfolio! This would be a good time to ensure everything is up to date, well organized, and easy to navigate. Think about users browsing your page as a portfolio, are they likely to download and open up “.fig” files, or would they rather see screen capture images presented in easily to see markdown files? How would you show off your interaction design?

Bonus points - start to think about the overall feel of your application - what colors of banners fit the theme? What fonts? Is there anything else that would help it stand out?

## Requirements
Please submit your .fig files to UR Courses by the due date.
